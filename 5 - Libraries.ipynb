    "Of course, we aren't the first people to define a function that computes the average value of a list of numbers. In fact, there are a lot of functions that are useful to us that other people have defined, so it would be nice if we can use their work instead of redefining all of these functions ourselves! Fortunately, this is possible. We've actually already used a function defined by other people when we wrote \"len(numbers)\" to find the number of values in the list. Here, we called a function called \"len,\" which was already defined by the mysterious python powers-that-be and is built into the language. There are more built in functions, but not all of the functions that we'd like to use are automatically included in python. In order to use these functions, we need to tell the computer where to find this functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we tell the computer that we would like to use a python package called \"numpy.\" Numpy is a collection of functions and other code which are useful for scientific computing. As before, we store the exam scores in a list. We then compute the average score using the \"average\" function in \"numpy.\" Writing \"numpy.average\" tells the computer to look inside of numpy to find the average function, rather than looking for a user defined function (like those we used before). Using this predefined function makes computing the average very easy!"
