# RunTheWorldMachineLearning

These Jupyter notebooks and related resources are for the Girls' Machine Learning Day Camp being run at the University of Minnesota by the [Minnesota Center for Financial and Actuarial Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/research-programs/mcfam) in partnership with folks from the [Mathematics Center for Educational Programs](http://www.mathcep.umn.edu/), both in the [School of Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/). Thank you very much to sponsorship from [Wells Fargo](https://wellsfargo.com) (Andrew Mack, senior quantitative audit manager, prompted us to start this whole thing!) and [CH Robinson](https://www.chrobinson.com/en-us/). 

Much of this will be linked to the [camp website](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~taipale/machine-learning-camp) which is currently ugly but has many links.
